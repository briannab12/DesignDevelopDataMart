# DesignDevelopDataMart
Design and develop a data mart for tracking the manufacturer, supplier, customer, and sale transactions of products from multiple organizations.

Dirty source data was given in .csv files in different formats. The team performed ETL functions using Pentaho. We used MySQL to create the database. We also demonstrated handling Slowly Changing Dimensions and Aggregated Data Marts.
